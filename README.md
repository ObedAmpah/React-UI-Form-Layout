# Simple Form Layout

####Goal

This is a simple form layout built with the React UI and Bootstrap Library. I chose to use Reactive Native syntax to make it easier on setting props (using an object vs a contructor function). This form still needs validation, but because it does not follow React's Form structure, that can be tabled.


###Setup

- Pull down the project files


	<strong>In the root folder run</strong>:

- `npm install` for all dependencies
- `gulp` to process the `main.scss` file
- `node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server` to start the webpack dev server
- Application will be served to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` (or just plain  `/`)
